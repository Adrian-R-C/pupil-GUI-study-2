# pupil-GUI-study-2


Code and instructions for pre-processing and statistical analysis of evoked pupillary responses used in the research paper **PREDICOG**.

The aim of the PrediCog study (Toulouse University Hospital, NCT06058897) was to investigate the link between locus coeruleus markers (pupillary response, functional and structural integrity) and cognitive performance, and the long-term evolution of this relationship. Pupil data were obtained from the EyeBrain T2 eyetracker from Suricog (Paris, France). More informations about the clinical trial : https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06058897

All the code was written on Matlab. A graphical interface based on Matlab's AppDesigner is available for those who don't want to go into the code but would like to reproduce the analyses 😉. If you're a Matlab or object-oriented enthusiast, you'll quickly notice that the code isn't optimized... but it works! 😏

For the moment, the code is adapted only to data from the EyeBrain T2 eyetracker, and no other device 🙇. However, you are completely free to appropriate and modify the code provided to adapt it to other eyetrackers or rewrite it in another language (GNU GPL-3.0 license).

There are already pupil data analysis scripts and libraries online, but perhaps my contribution can encourage others to improve on my work or even propose a universal matlab pipeline, all accompanied by an easy-to-use interface 😏.
